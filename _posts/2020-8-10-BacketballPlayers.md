As a fun and cool mini project for my Data Mining course, I found a data set of these three great basketball players stats.Then I used machine learning algorithms such as KNN, Logistic Regression and SVM via Python, Pandas and scikit-learn and finally did following tasks:
Mixing MJ, KB and LJ stats, finding average stats and finally predict their performance by age.(I used KNN and Logistic Regression)
Find the playerâ€™s name by giving age and performance(average points). (I used SVM)
