# Projects
Here are some of the projects I’ve developed during my career.
2020

**Persian Handwritten Digit Recognition​**: During my second time of working with image
classifiers, I had a chance to design and develop a recognizer for a persian handwritten
digit dataset(a persian alternative to mnist dataset). Then, I compared the accuracy of
CNN with a multi layer perceptron and answers once again showed how good
convolutionals can be in this field. I have also used Python and Keras for the purpose.
<br>
<br>
2020
<br>

**Hospital Database​**: I developed and designed a simple hospital database using
Microsoft SQL Server. I’ve also written some queries, functions, triggers and executed a
few store procedures on the database
2019
New York City Neighbourhood Map by Clustering​ : By a New York City Buildings
Stats dataset, I used clustering algorithms KMeans and DBScan to make a secondary
map using their latitudes and longitudes which shows neighbours and their boundary.
Finally it can be visible how accurate these algorithms act compared to the real world.
I’ve also used Python, Pandas and scikit-learn for this project.
<br>
<br>

2019
<br>

**Which one? Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant or Lebron James​**: As a fun and cool
project, I found a data set of these three great basketball players stats.Then I used
machine learning algorithms such as KNN, Logistic Regression and SVM via Python,
Pandas and scikit-learn and finally did following tasks:
* Mixing MJ, KB and LJ stats, finding average stats and finally predict their performance by
age.(I used KNN and Logistic Regression)
* Find the player’s name by giving age and performance(average points). (I used SVM)
<br>
<br>

2019
<br>

**Image Classifier**: ​ As final project of my Image Processing course, a 10000 length
dataset with 100 classes where given and classification was desired. As I started using
python, I’ve solved the mentioned problem with a convolutional neural network via Keras
library.
<br>
<br>

2017
<br>

**Data File Handler​**: In this project, some description and information about datafiles(such as Format. Author, Creation Date, Modification Date, etc ) are stored and can
be manipulated visually via Swing library which I’ve developed, using Java. Also it was
the first time during my career that I’ve used Object Oriented methods.
<br>
<br>

2016
<br>

**Graph Characteristic Minner**: ​ As an initial project since starting my academic
education, I’ve used my first learned programming language(C++), in order to give a
graph to the input as a matrix, and extract some features from it which some of them
are:
* Graph Degree
* Maximum and minimum degree of nodes
* Path through two given nodes
* Shortest existing path in graph
* Finding ​ Hamiltonian path
* Finding ​ Eulerian path
* Finding graph’s eigenvalue
* Checking if graph is a tree or not
* Checking graph connectivity
* Checking if graph is planar or not
* Checking graph isomorphism
* Checking graph completeness

# Hobbies
I love swimming as my #1 favorite sport. I am also fully proficient in 4 main styles.
Besides sports, I am passionate about self development, working on my mentals and
reading motivational books. And it’s good to say I really like classic rock songs
especially Pink Floyd and Nickelback’s rock.
