# Hobbies
I love swimming as my number 1 favorite sport. I am also fully proficient in 4 main styles. Besides sports, I am passionate about self-development, working on my mentals, and reading motivational books. And it’s good to say I really like classic rock songs especially Pink Floyd and Nickelback’s rock.
